Temporal topology is described in terms of time complexes, nodes, and edges, and the connectivity between these. Temporal topology does not directly provide information about temporal position. It is used in the case of describing a lineage or a history (e.g. a family tree expressing evolution of species, an ecological cycle, a lineage of lands or buildings, or a history of separation and merger of administrative boundaries). The following Subclauses specifies the temporal topology as temporal characteristics of features in compliance with ISO 19108.
